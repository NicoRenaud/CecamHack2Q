# 2nd Quantization with NQS - Kickstart

This is a repository to provide an easy-to-use starting point for developing NQS methodology as a solver for ab initio electronic structure problems in 2nd quantization. Thos was developed as part of the hackathon of the CECAM flagship workshop "Open software for neural wavefunctions".

See the [Jupyter notebook second_quant_NQS_ab_initio.ipynb](second_quant_NQS_ab_initio.ipynb) to get started...
